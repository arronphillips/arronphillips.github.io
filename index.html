<h1><center>My SnapEngage Test Page</center></h1>

<h2><center>Dashboard</center></h2>
<p>Sign up was pretty breezy. My first agent account was ready to go and the code implementation only took a minute. 
Dashboard is well laid out with easy navigation on the left and an informative header bar for each section displayed 
once a section is chosen. Analytics seemed basic but powerful, especially the visitor information page as I know this 
is sometimes overlooked but very useful for many online companies. Chat log page is pretty basic and could be styled a 
little better to better help find information faster. I have not yet found a way to search keywords in past chats which 
could be helpful but you could work around that with the .csv export. Chat log also acts undesirable if you click on a 
past chat in the “Last Contacts” row, it will take you to the past chat but will then no longer display the latest chats 
to navigate to.</p>

<h2><center>Initial Chats</center></h2>
