<h1><center>My SnapEngage Test Page</center></h1>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2><center>Dashboard</center></h2>
<p>Sign up was pretty breezy. My first agent account was ready to go and the code implementation only took a minute. 
Dashboard is well laid out with easy navigation on the left and an informative header bar for each section displayed 
once a section is chosen.</p>
<br/>
<p>Analytics seemed basic but powerful, especially the visitor information page as I know this 
is sometimes overlooked but very useful for many online companies.</p> 
<br/>
<p>Chat log page is pretty basic and could be styled a to better help find information faster. I have not yet found a way 
to search keywords in past chats which could be helpful but you could work around that with the .csv export. Chat log also 
acts undesirable if you click on a past chat in the “Last Contacts” row, it will take you to the past chat but will then no 
longer display the latest chats 
to navigate to.</p>

<h2><center>Initial Chats</center></h2>
<p>Chat portal seems pretty basic and easy to understand. Would like to see 
it in action with multiple agents and live chats going at the same time to see if confusion ensues or if starting new chats 
as well as transferring them is as easy as everything else has been so far.</p>
<br/>
<p>Good amount of profile information is pulled 
for the user if available but the map is buggy at times (see screenshot below). Profile quickly allows you to get a good 
feel of who you are assisting which could help you tailor your responses if needed. History of communication is a huge help 
as it is given to you at the start of each chat.</p>
<br/>
<p>Shortcut to canned responses is at your fingertips although it did take me a fair 
amount of searching to find where to manage my canned responses. I like the bar display showing current chat status up to 4 chats for each agent. 
Proactive chat is easy to understand and edit as well.</p>
